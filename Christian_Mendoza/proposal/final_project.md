# Money Manager Web App Development Proposal

### Goals/Expectations
The proposed development of a money manager web application would serve the needs of easily keeping on top of one's finances. Combining an expense manager, bill reminder, checkbook register and budget planner,
the web app will be a great option for people who want quick and easy data entry and detailed financial information, and who don't want or have the need to link personal accounts. It will not require users to give any personal financial account information; simply enter the current income and start adding daily and month expenses.

### Features of the App
Proposed features of the web app, still to be decided on:

* Unlimited number of transactions
* Multiple accounts (checking, savings, credit card, etc.)
* Email notifications of balance, upcoming and overdue bills
* Color-coded table displaying transaction name, date, amount, category, type* Total balance updated in real-time
* Calendar view
* Pie chart/line graph of all transactions by category
* Repeating transactions
* Transfers between accounts
* Responsive design for mobile and tablet device support
* CSV export support
* Bills & receipts photo attachments
